      <description>Hi! My name is Dinesh, you may also know me as dosa_boi from other circles. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a CS and Astronomy Junior at UIUC.
Besides coding, I like to cook, sing, backpack and stargaze. You&amp;rsquo;ll see me writing posts about these alongside whatever else comes to mind.
Enjoy your stay!
