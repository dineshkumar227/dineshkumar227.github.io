      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m lazy. Really. I love cooking and I&amp;rsquo;m really picky about what I eat but it&amp;rsquo;s at odds with my innate laziness. I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna chop things and have a million different foods for a meal. I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna meal-prep things a week in advance cause I hate reheating the same shit over and over, I want variety. I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna wait for 2 hours for those long braised dishes because the impatient child in me refuses to wait more than 30 minutes.</description>

      <description>Kate on her first tour
  I discovered Kate Bush on yet another of my late night TV Tropes binges. I was looking to see if harsh vocals existed outside of metal when I came upon a description of Waking the Witch : &amp;ldquo;Kate Bush used it in 1985 with &amp;ldquo;Waking The Witch&amp;rdquo;. In this case, she provided both voices: one track is her natural voice, the other is a drastically slowed down demonic growl.</description>

      <description>Hi! My name is Dinesh, you may also know me as dosa_boi from other circles. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a CS and Astronomy Junior at UIUC.
Besides coding, I like to cook, sing, backpack and stargaze. You&amp;rsquo;ll see me writing posts about these alongside whatever else comes to mind.
Enjoy your stay!
