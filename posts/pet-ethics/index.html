        <p>I think dogs are one of the cruelest things humanity has done. We&rsquo;ve taken the
majestic, independent wolf and genetically engineered to become our
friend-slave. Well, that&rsquo;s the fate of the lucky ones. Some dogs are trained for
a lifetime of servitude of labour (K9 and Sled Dogs), some are merely vessels of
narcissism of their owners, being forced to learn &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; and other useless
bullshit in order to compete in dick measuring contests with other narcissists.</p>
<p>A common, and valid response is that dogs love to be pets and companions.
Learning tricks and pleasing their owners does give dogs pleasure. However, I&rsquo;d
argue that this is nothing more than genetically engineered Stockholm Syndrome.
Whenever a dog doesn&rsquo;t show these traits, it gets termed as &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; or
&ldquo;rabid&rdquo; and gets sent to shelters to be murdered. Sometimes dogs are murdered
just because they&rsquo;re not cute enough to be adopted.</p>
<p>The worst part of all this we can&rsquo;t simply let our pets out into the wild. Most
dogs are completely dependent on their owners and would not survive a month in
the wild. Even if they could, our cities are not built to handle dog
overpopulation from a bunch of unneutered dogs running about.</p>
<p>With shelter in place orders in full swing, p</p>
